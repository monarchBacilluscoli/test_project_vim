# Test Project Vim

This is used for vim and other tools learning and test in CLI of Linux.

For now, I have learned:
* vim: split
	* plugins: auto complete, formatting
* make & makefile
* gdb
* tmux: split, copy & paste
through this project.

Thumb up! Although I still have to face my damn research topic again. I must be killed by that some day.
